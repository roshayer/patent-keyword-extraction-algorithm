    "- Patents are an important part of intellectual property. Patent mining can be divided into patent metadata mining and patent text mining. In this project, we are going to focus on patent text mining. Patent classification is the most important task in patent mining; we can use keywords to predict the classification of the patents. \n",
    "\n",
    "- PKEA is based on the skip-gram model for patent classification. It can be used to extract both semantic and discriminative keywords without the need of a corpus. It has low computational complexity meaning that it is easier to implement. High performance on extracting discriminative keywords. Easy to implement and apply to other type of texts. The biggest drawback is that it requires a pre-defined category corpus. It is specially designed for extracting keywords from patent text. Easy to extend to other scientific articles. \n",
    "\n",
    "- All the keyword-based patent mining techniques are based on the assumption that the keywords can represent the corresponding patent document well. Quality of advanced patent analysis relies on the quality of the extracted keywords. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Best performances achieved on SemEval-2010 and Hulth2003 are 27.2% and 38.7% respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Some of the issues include: redundant expression, polysemy, synonyms, thesaurus updating dynamically & interdisciplinary content complexity. \n",

    "- Both RAKE and PKEA are unsupervised models \n",
    "\n",
    "- Skip-Gram Model (Word2Vec) is applied to training corpus to pre-train word embeddings. After pre-training Word2VecTales is obtained by applying the skip-gram model. Patents in each category, the correspondng words are converted to vectors. K-means algorithm is used to generate the centroid vector. After obtaining centroid vector, each candidate keywords list is converted to a vectors list. The similarity values between candidate keyword to centroid vector is calculated using cosine similarity. Finally the top n keywords for each patent document is obtained by sorting the KeywordsDict by value. The keywords are extracted from patent texts by applying PKEA.\n",

This paper proposes a new approach of unsupervised hybrid word alignment technique using ensemble learning method. This algorithm uses three base alignment models in several rounds to generate alignments. The ensemble algorithm uses a weighed scheme for resampling training data and a voting score to consider aggregated alignments. The underlying alignment algorithms used in this study include IBM Model 1', '2 and a heuristic method based on Dice measurement.

Consequently', 'it seems natural to consider how a spectral learner could make use of multiple representations when learning. This paper proposes and compares three approaches to learning from multiple spectral representations.

The clustering ensembles combine multiple partitions generated by different clustering algorithms into a single clustering solution.

Some instances (such as outliers or noise) can be detrimental. However', 'at least initially', 'the instances in a data set are generally considered equally in machine learning algorithms. Many current approaches for handling noisy and detrimental instances make a binary decision about whether an instance is detrimental or not. In this paper', 'we 1) extend this paradigm by weighting the instances on a continuous scale and 2) present a methodology for measuring how detrimental an instance may be for inducing a model of the data. We call our method of identifying and weighting detrimental instances reduced detrimental instance learning (RDIL). We examine RIDL on a set of 54 data sets and 5 learning algorithms and compare RIDL with other weighting and filtering approaches. RDIL is especially useful for learning algorithms where every instance can affect the classification boundary and the training instances are considered individually', 'such as multilayer perceptrons trained with backpropagation (MLPs).

Additionally', 'given the significant importance that social networks gained as information networks', 'there is an ever-growing interest in the extraction of complex information used for trend detection', 'promoting services or market sensing. This dynamic nature tends to limit the performance of traditional static learning models and dynamic learning strategies must be put forward. In this paper we present a learning strategy to learn in the presence of concept drift in Twitter. We propose three different models: a time-window model', 'an ensemble-based model and an incremental model. Since little is known about the types of drift that can occur in Twitter', 'we simulate different types of drift by artificially timestamping real Twitter messages in order to evaluate and validate our strategy. Results are so far encouraging regarding learning in the presence of drift', 'along with classifying messages in Twitter streams.\",Ensemble Methods,2014'), ('6,High Precision Screening for Android Malware with Dimensionality Reduction,\"dimensionality reduction', 'mobile security', 'android', 'principal components analysis\",\"This work presents a new method of classifying previously unseen Android applications as malware or benign.

The Q-learning method is embedded as part of the software itself to provide a security mechanism that has ability to learn by itself to develop a temporary repair mechanism. The results of the experiment express that given the right parameters and the right setting the Q-learning approach rapidly learns to block all alicious actions.

The signature of an individual is visually acquired by using pen based tracking system (1)', '(2). This paper considers the possibility of discretizing visually acquired signatures to represent them as an unordered collection of words and then use Sequential Mining Optimization (SMO) for training Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify the signature as either legitimate or forged. The discretizing of the signature is done by using Symbolic Aggregate Approximation (SAX) (4). SAX reduces the dimensions of the signature and produces a list of SAX words which are then represented as a bag-of-patterns model for classification purposes (5). The data set consisted of more than 3960 signatures of 106 subjects distributed across two sets. The results obtained provided good classification accuracy and additionally provided an insight into the unique pattern of each subjects signature.\",Applications in Security,2014'), ('10,Detection of abnormal human behavior using a matrix approximation-based approach,\"abnormal event detection', 'low-rank approximation', 'adaptive learning\",\"Automatic detection of abnormal events is one of central tasks in video surveillance.

This paper proposes a new approach of unsupervised hybrid word alignment technique using ensemble learning method. This algorithm uses three base alignment models in several rounds to generate alignments. The ensemble algorithm uses a weighed scheme for resampling training data and a voting score to consider aggregated alignments. The underlying alignment algorithms used in this study include IBM Model 1, 2 and a heuristic method based on Dice measurement. Our experimental results show that by this approach, the alignment error rate could be improved by at least %15 for the base alignment models.'],\n",

However, there are many possible spectral representations, none of which will be best in all situations. Consequently, it seems natural to consider how a spectral learner could make use of multiple representations when learning. This paper proposes and compares three approaches to learning from multiple spectral representations. Empirical results suggest that an ensemble approach to multi-spectrum learning, in which spectral models are learned independently in each of a set of candidate representations and then combined in a majority-vote ensemble, works best in practice.'],\n",

Defect detection systems predict defects by using software metrics and data mining techniques. Clustering analysis is adopted to build the software defect prediction models. Cluster ensembles have emerged as a prominent method for improving robustness, stability and accuracy of clustering solutions. The clustering ensembles combine multiple partitions generated by different clustering algorithms into a single clustering solution. In this paper, the clustering ensemble using Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) solution is proposed to improve the predict quality. An empirical study shows that the PSO can be a good choice to build defect prediction software  models.'],\n",

However, at least initially, the instances in a data set are generally considered equally in machine learning algorithms. Many current approaches for handling noisy and detrimental instances make a binary decision about whether an instance is detrimental or not. In this paper, we 1) extend this paradigm by weighting the instances on a continuous scale and 2) present a methodology for measuring how detrimental an instance may be for inducing a model of the data. We call our method of identifying and weighting detrimental instances reduced detrimental instance learning (RDIL). We examine RIDL on a set of 54 data sets and 5 learning algorithms and compare RIDL with other weighting and filtering approaches. RDIL is especially useful for learning algorithms where every instance can affect the classification boundary and the training instances are considered individually, such as multilayer perceptrons trained with backpropagation (MLPs). Our results also suggest that a more accurate estimate of which instances are detrimental can have a significant positive impact for handling them.'],\n",

The learning model must not only have the ability to continuously learn, but also the ability to change already acquired concepts. Additionally, given the significant importance that social networks gained as information networks, there is an ever-growing interest in the extraction of complex information used for trend detection, promoting services or market sensing. This dynamic nature tends to limit the performance of traditional static learning models and dynamic learning strategies must be put forward. In this paper we present a learning strategy to learn in the presence of concept drift in Twitter. We propose three different models: a time-window model, an ensemble-based model and an incremental model. Since little is known about the types of drift that can occur in Twitter, we simulate different types of drift by artificially timestamping real Twitter messages in order to evaluate and validate our strategy. Results are so far encouraging regarding learning in the presence of drift, along with classifying messages in Twitter streams.'],\n",

The algorithm starts with a large set of features: the frequencies of all possible n-byte sequences in the application's byte code.

However, when referring to a high-order RBM, since there are interactions among its visible layers, the gradient approximation via CD learning usually becomes far from the log-likelihood gradient and even may cause CD learning to fall into the infinite loop with high reconstruction error. In this paper, a new algorithm named Cyclic Contrastive Divergence (CCD) is introduced for learning high-order RBMs. Unlike the standard CD algorithm, CCD updates the parameters according to each visible layer in turn, by borrowing the idea of Cyclic Block Coordinate Descent method.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA), is the classical way of dimensional reduction. However, traditional Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) based PCA fails to model data which largely deviates from Gaussian distribution. The Bregman Divergence was recently introduced to achieve a generalized PCA framework. If the random variables under dimensional reduction follow Bernoulli distribution, which occurs in many emerging fields, the generalized PCA is called Logistic PCA (LPCA). In this paper, we extend the batch LPCA to a sequential version (i.e. SLPCA), based on the sequential convex optimization theory. The convergence property of this algorithm is discussed compared to the batch version of LPCA (i.e. BLPCA), as well as its performance in reducing the dimension for multivariate binary-state systems. Its application in building energy end-use profile modeling is also investigated.'],\n",

Parametric based system such as HMMs have been the dominant technology for speech recognition in the past decade. Despite a lot of advancements and enhancements in the design of these systems:  key problems such as long term temporal dependence, etc. has not yet been solved. Recently due to availability of large amount of data and inexpensive computing resources (processing power and memory) parametric based approach to solve speech recognition and classification task is becoming popular and feasible. The key advantage of parametric based approach is that all the information from the training data is retained as we dont approximate our data with specific statistical models resulting in more speaker specific information. In this paper we propose a kNN phoneme prediction scheme using speaker ranking vector. Speaker ranking vector is generated by finding the similarity of the given TEST speaker with the training data using kNN. The results were compared with nearest neighbor and kNN majority voting approach. Our proposed scheme gives a better prediction accuracy as compare with nearest neighbor and kNN majority voting scheme. This approach can help speech recognizer to customize on the fly for a given talker and customize training data on the basis of similarity measure.'],\n",

The spectral learner extends the word presence model by applying Boolean logic operators (AND, OR, and XOR) to the word presence features to identify useful higher-order features. These spectral features can be used in other learning algorithms, and we show how the performance of other learning algorithms can be improved by these features.

Recommendation systems are critical components of such markets. It is to be noted that the matching in such a market depends on the preferences of both sides, consequently, the construction of a recommendation system for such a market calls for consideration of preferences of both sides. The online dating market, and the online freelancer market are examples of markets with two-sided preferences. Past studies on building recommendation systems for such markets, however, lacks a systematic approach. We observe that constructing recommendation systems for markets with two-sided preferences can be posed as an Area Under the receiver operator Curve(AUC) optimization problem. Generalized linear regression models are popular methods of constructing ranking or recommendation systems in such markets on account of their ability to be learned easily from big data, and their computational simplicity on engineering platforms. We conjecture that it is more likely for matching in such markets to be a complex combination of preferences of both sides. To account for this, we introduce a novel two-level model for optimizing the AUC of matching in such markets. For both synthetic and real data we show that the two-level model algorithm has a better AUC performance than the direct application of a generalized linear model such as $L_{1}$ logistic regression or an ensemble method such as random forest algorithm. We provide a theoretical justification of AUC optimality of two-level model and pose a theoretical problem for a more general result.

The parameter setting of PID control is not optimal for the improvement of transient-state characteristics since the setting needs to satisfy stable steady-state characteristics.

In its general form, this problem is referred to as the Object Partitioning Problem (OOP), known to be NP-hard. We here consider a variant of OPP, namely the Stochastic Online Equi-Partitioning Problem (SO-EPP). In SO-EPP, objects arrive sequentially, in pairs. The relationship between the arriving object pairs is stochastic: They belong to the same partition with probability p. From a history of object arrivals, the goal is to predict which objects will appear together in future arrivals. As an additional complication, the partitions of related objects are required to be of equal cardinality. The decision maker, however, is not informed about the true relation between the objects, he is merely observing the stream of object pairs, and has to predict future behavior. Inferring the correct partitioning from historical behavior is thus a significant challenge, which becomes even more difficult when p is unknown. Previously, only heuristic sub-optimal solution strategies have been proposed for SO-EPP. In this paper, we propose the first it optimal solution strategy. In brief, the scheme that we propose, BN-EPP, is founded on a Bayesian Network representation of SO-EPP problems. Based on probabilistic reasoning we are not only able to infer the correct object partitioning with optimal accuracy. We are also able to simultaneously infer p, allowing us to accelerate learning as object pairs arrive. Being optimal, BN-EPP provides superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art solution schemes. BN-EPP is also highly flexible, being capable of encoding object partitioning constraints. Finally, BN-EPP is parameter free - its performance does not rely on fine tuning any parameters. As a result of these advantages, BN-EPP opens up for significantly improved performance for OOP based applications.'],\n",

In addition, pitch angle sensors complete failure can lead to dangerous actions of the controller, while fixed or drifted bias of sensor measurements may decrease the controller's efficiency.

As a major drawback, EFIS depends on detection of the object of interest for feature calculation, a task that is highly application-dependent.

The new EFIS, called self-configuring EFIS (SC-EFIS), uses available training data to auto-configure the parameters that are fixed in EFIS.

Machine learning techniques that can construct a Bayesian network from past data automatically are well developed in recent years. If we consider past data as a sampling set from an original probabilistic distribution, the \"learning\" process is actually trying to reproduce the original probabilistic distribution from the sampling set. Therefore, the finiteness of size of sampling set will bring uncertainties to the reproduced parameters of constructed Bayesian network. When the constructed Bayesian network is used to predict future, the uncertainties of reproduced parameters will be transferred to the uncertainty of query response. Here, the query response is the posterior probability that we are interested in. Evaluating the uncertainty of query response is critical to some strict industrial applications. Previous researches have proposed a method to evaluate the uncertainty. The consequence is shown as a variance of the query response. However, the conventional method need to work together with the bucket elimination, an exact inference method. Therefore, the conventional method can not deal with large Bayesian networks that used in real applications because of its calculation cost. We proposed a new approach to calculate the uncertainty of query responses by using joint probability distribution in this research. The proposed method can work with any inference method. Therefore, it can give an approximate evaluation even when the Bayesian network is large by using an approximate inference method.

In addition, we assumed that each classifier has two classes, and the outputs of classifiers are dependent and identically distributed. We validated our model using computer simulations. Results show that the ensemble performance is highly sensitive to class variance while exhibits a smoother behavior against class mean. Also, results show that as the correlation among classifiers' outputs increases, the probability of classification error degrades exponentially.

However, given the high label costs, dependence of an expert, limitations in data transmission or even restrictions imposed by the problem's nature, there is a large number of real-world applications in which the availability of actual labels is infinitely delayed (never available). In these cases, it is necessary the use of algorithms that does not follow the traditional process of monitoring the error rate to detect changes in data distribution and uses the most recent labeled data to update the classification model. In this paper, we propose the method MClassification to classify evolving data streams with infinitely delayed labels. Our method is inspired on the use of Micro-Cluster representation from online clustering algorithms. Considering the presence of incremental drifts, our approach uses a distance-based strategy to maintain the Micro-Clusters' positions updated. An evaluation in several synthetic and real data shows that MClassification achieves competitive accuracy results to state-of-the-art methods and adequate computational cost.

We consider a collection of features, some novel and some inspired by features that worked well for sleep apnea detection using other types of sensors (i.e., not IR-UWB). To extract the features, we collected a total of 25 hours of data from four subjects as they slept through the night. The data included digitized samples of the IR-UWB radar return signal and the scored polysomnograph (PSG), which is the gold standard and measures a large number of physiological parameters in a well-equipped sleep laboratory. Normal and apnea epochs were extracted from the IR-UWB data corresponding to normal and apnea epochs in the PSG data. Statistical features were derived from these extracted epochs and a Linear Discriminant classifier was trained. Using cross-validation, we found that the classifier had an accuracy of around 70% in detection of apnea and normal epochs. The novel aspect of this project involves processing and investigation of different methods for feature extraction on data obtained from real apnea subjects and suggests that the radar, when paired with other under-the-mattress sensors might provide an effective screening device in a convenient form factor.'],\n",

Due to the blindness of manually extracted features, it was hard to choose suitable features for the specific classification task. Besides, this heuristic method for feature extraction could not generalize across different application domains, because different application domains needed to extract different features for classification. There was also work that used auto-encoders to learn features automatically and then fed the features into the K-nearest neighbor classifier. However, these features were learned in an unsupervised manner without using the information of the labels, thus might not be related to the specific classification task. In this paper, we recommend deep neural networks (DNNs) for activity recognition, which can automatically learn suitable features. DNNs overcome the blindness of hand-designed features and make use of the precious label information to improve activity recognition performance. We did experiments on three publicly available datasets for activity recognition and compared deep neural networks with traditional methods, including those that extracted features manually and auto-encoders followed by a K-nearest neighbor classifier.

In the first step a deep neural network is trained using raw Mel-frequency cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features to discover hidden structures in the data and employing the activations of the last hidden layers of the DNN as acoustic features. In the second step using nearest neighbor, an adaptation algorithm learns speaker similarity scores based on a small amount of adaptation data from each target speaker using the DNN-based acoustic features. Based on the speaker similarity score, classification is done using a k-nearest neighbor (k-NN) classifier. The novelty of this work is that instead of modifying and re-training the DNN for speaker adaptation, which comprises a large number of parameters and is computationally expensive, activations of the learned DNN are used to project features from MFCC to a sparse DNN space, then speaker adaptation is performed based on similarity (i.e. nearest neighbor) using k-NN algorithm. With only a small amount of adaptation data, it reduces the number of phoneme classification error in the TIMIT dataset by 23%.

OpenMP tasks allow programmers to express unstructured parallelism at a high level of abstraction and make the runtime responsible about the burden of scheduling parallel execution. For irregular applications, the performance of task scheduling cannot often be predicted due to the nature of application, the used compiler, and the platform/architecture dependencies.

Therefore, we have prototyped a new kind of code search engine for online forums that draws upon unsupervised machine learning in two ways. First, it displays code samples in visual groupings based on the mutual similarity of code samples. Second, it uses the assignment of code samples to clusters to achieve a form of query expansion, thereby identifying additional search results as potentially useful. We evaluated the system by running it on the forum for the LabVIEW programming language. A textual analysis of posts showed that the unsupervised machine learning algorithm successfully tended to assign code samples to clusters based on topical similarity.

In this paper, we study what happens from theoretical point of view, when a variable selection method assumes a linear regression function and the underlying ground-truth model is composed of a linear and a non-linear term, that is at most partially linear. We demonstrate consistency of the Lasso method when the model is partially linear. However, we note that the algorithm tends to increase even more the number of selected false positives on partially linear models when given few training samples. That is usually because the values of small groups of samples happen to explain variation coming from the non-linear part of the response function and the noise, using a linear combination of wrong predictors. We demonstrate theoretically that false positives are likely to be selected by the Lasso method due to a small proportion of samples, which happen to explain some variation in the response variable. We show that this property implies that if we run the Lasso on several slightly smaller size data replications, sampled without replacement, and intersect the results, we are likely to reduce the number of false positives without losing already selected true positives.

We present a novel horizon line detection approach which uses machine learning and Dynamic Programming (DP) to extract the horizon line from a classification map instead of an edge map. The key idea is assigning a classification score to each pixel, which can be interpreted as the likelihood of the pixel belonging to the horizon line, and representing the classification map as a multi-stage graph. Using DP, the horizon line can be extracted by finding the path that maximizes the sum of classification scores. In contrast to edge maps which are typically binary (edge vs no-edge) and contain gaps, classification maps are continuous and contain no gaps, yielding significantly better solutions. Using classification maps instead of edge maps allows for removing certain assumptions such as the horizon is close to the top of the image or that the horizon forms a straight line. The purpose of these assumptions is to bias the DP solution but they fail to produce good results when they are not valid. We demonstrate our approach on three different data sets and provide comparisons with a traditional approach based on edge maps.

This process is mimicked by simulating the transformations that normally occur in of acquiring the image in a real world application, such as using a scanner to acquire digits for a check amount or using a camera in an autonomous car. These small transformations negate the effect of the carefully crafted perturbations of adversarial examples, resulting in a correct classification by the deep neural network.

The challenges stem from a variety of issues, but recent literature has shown that this task is hard to solve with high accuracy when only a restricted set of features, like permissions or similar fixed sets of features, are used. The opposite approach of including all available features is also problematic, as it causes the features space to grow beyond reasonable size. In this paper we focus on finding an efficient way to select a representative feature space, preserving its discriminative power on unseen data. We go beyond traditional approaches like Principal Component Analysis, which is too heavy for large-scale problems with millions of features. In particular we show that many feature groups that can be extracted from Android application packages, like features extracted from the manifest file or strings extracted from the Dalvik Executable (DEX), should be filtered and used in classification separately. Our proposed dimensionality reduction scheme is applied to each group separately and consists of raw string preprocessing, feature selection via log-odds and finally applying random projections. With the size of the feature space growing exponentially as a function of the training set's size, our approach drastically decreases the size of the feature space of several orders of magnitude, this in turn allows accurate classification to become possible in a real world scenario. After reducing the dimensionality we use the feature groups in a light-weight ensemble of logistic classifiers.

However, for continuous optimisation problems or problems with a large number of actions, bandit based approaches can be hindered by slow learning. Gradient based approaches, on the other hand, navigate quickly in high-dimensional continuous spaces through local optimisation, following the gradient in fine grained steps. However, apart from being susceptible to local optima, these schemes are also less suited for online learning due to their reliance on extensive trial-and-error before the optimum can be identified. In contrast, bandit algorithms seek to identify the optimal action (global optima) in as few steps as possible. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach that unifies the above two distinct paradigms in one single framework, with the aim of combining their advantages. At the heart of our approach we find a stochastic linear approximation of the function to be optimised, where both the gradient and values of the function are explicitly captured. This model allows us to learn from both noisy function and gradient observations, as well as predicting these properties across the action space to support optimisation. We further propose an accompanying bandit driven exploration scheme that uses Bayesian credible bounds to trade off exploration against exploitation. Our empirical results demonstrate that by unifying bandit and gradient based learning, one obtains consistently improved performance across a wide spectrum of problem environments. Furthermore, even when gradient feedback is unavailable, the flexibility of our model, including gradient prediction, still allows us outperform competing approaches, although with a smaller margin.'],\n",

       "        'In this paper, we propose an efficient solution for the privacy-preserving of a bipartite ranking algorithm. The bipartite ranking problem can be considered as finding a function that ranks positive instances (in a dataset) higher than the negative ones. However, one common concern for all the existing schemes is the privacy of individuals in the dataset. That is, one (e.g., a researcher) needs to access the records of all individuals in the dataset in order to run the algorithm. This privacy concern puts limitations on the use of sensitive personal data for such analysis. The RIMARC (Ranking Instances by Maximizing Area under the ROC Curve) algorithm solves the bipartite ranking problem by learning a model to rank instances. As part of the model, it learns weights for each feature by analyzing the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. RIMARC algorithm is shown to be more accurate and efficient than its counterparts. Thus, we use this algorithm as a building-block and provide a privacy-preserving version of the RIMARC algorithm using homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation. Our proposed algorithm lets a data owner outsource the storage and processing of its encrypted dataset to a semi-trusted cloud. Then, a researcher can get the results of his/her queries (to learn the ranking function) on the dataset by interacting with the cloud. During this process, neither the researcher nor the cloud learns any information about the raw dataset. We prove the security of the proposed algorithm and show its efficiency via experiments on real data.'],\n",

       "        'Evolving networks, which are composed of objects and relationships that change over time, are prevalent in many real-world domains and have become an significant research topic in recent years. Most of the previous link prediction studies neglect the evolution of the network over time and mainly focus on the predicting the future links based on a static features of nodes and links. However, real-world networks have complex dynamic structures and non-linear varying topological features, which means that both nodes and links of the networks may appear or disappear. These dynamicity of the networks make link prediction a more challenging task. To overcome these difficulties, link prediction in such networks must model nonlinear temporal evolution of the topological features and link occurrences information of the network structure simultaneously. In this article, we propose a novel link prediction method based on NARX Neural Network for evolving networks. Our model first calculates similarity scores based on quasi-local measures for each pair of nodes in different snapshots of the network and create time series for each pair. Then, NARX network is effectively applied to prediction of the future node similarity scores by using past node similarities and node connectivities. The proposed method is tested on DBLP coauthorship networks. It is shown that combining time information with node similarities and node connectivities improves the link prediction performance to a large extent.'],\n",

While on-site recommendation systems focus on finding the most relevant items for a user at the moment (right item), email recommendations add two critical additional dimensions: who to send recommendations to (right person) and when to send them (right time). It is critical that a recommendation email system not send too many emails to too many users in too short of a time-window, as users may unsubscribe from future emails or become desensitized and ignore future emails if they receive too many. Also, email service providers may mark such emails as spam if too many of their users are contacted in a short time-window. Optimizing email recommendation systems such that they can yield a maximum response rate for a minimum number of email sends is thus critical for the long-term performance of such a system. In this paper, we present a novel recommendation email system that not only generates recommendations, but which also leverages a combination of individual user activity data, as well as the behavior of the group to which they belong, in order to determine each user's likelihood to respond to any given set of recommendations within a given time period.

Main challenges for the development of such algorithms are the consideration of vehicle nonholonomic constraints and the efficiency in terms of implementation, so that algorithms run in real time in a vehicle. The recently introduced Augmented CL-RRT algorithm is an approach that uses analytical models for trajectory planning based on the brute force evaluation of many longitudinal acceleration profiles to find collision-free trajectories. The algorithm considers nonholonomic constraints of the vehicle in complex road traffic scenarios with multiple static and dynamic objects, but it requires a lot of computation time. This work proposes a hybrid machine learning approach for predicting suitable acceleration profiles in critical traffic scenarios, so that only few acceleration profiles are used with the Augmented CL-RRT to find a safe trajectory while reducing the computation time. This is realized using a convolutional neural network variant, introduced as 3D-ConvNet, which learns spatiotemporal features from a sequence of predicted occupancy grids generated from predictions of other road traffic participants. These learned features together with hand-designed features of the EGO vehicle are used to predict acceleration profiles. Simulations are performed to compare the brute force approach with the proposed approach in terms of efficiency and safety. The results show vast improvement in terms of efficiency without harming safety.

The algorithm achieves novelty detection and concept drift thanks to a forgetting function that allows micro-clusters and final clusters to appear, drift, merge, split or disappear.

For instance, using images from ImageNet dataset, we found that adding an average of 14.25% impulse noise is enough to deceive the API. Our findings indicate the vulnerability of the API in adversarial environments. For example, an adversary can bypass an image filtering system by adding noise to inappropriate images. We then show that when a noise filter is applied on input images, the API generates mostly the same outputs for restored images as for original images.

A transfer learning environment is characterized by the unavailability of labeled data from the target domain, due to data being rare or too expensive to obtain. However, there exists abundant labeled data from a different, but similar domain. These two domains are likely to have different distribution characteristics. Transfer learning algorithms attempt to align the distribution characteristics of the source and target domains to create high-performance classifiers. This paper provides comparative performance analysis between stateof- the-art transfer learning algorithms and traditional machine learning algorithms under the domain class imbalance condition. The domain class imbalance condition is characterized by the source and target domains having different class probabilities, which can create marginal distribution differences between the source and target data.

Our experimental results indicate that when training on regular images and testing on negative images, the model accuracy is significantly lower than when it is tested on regular images.

Finally, state-oriented modeling approach has been adopted to design the detailed model of crossing region. Further, this paper uses the coverability tree to verify the specifications of crossing regions. By taking the crossing point as center, a circular region is introduced for safety purpose.

The browsing through such a large collection of videos is a challenging and time-consuming task. Despite the advancement in technology automatic browsing, retrieval, manipulation and analysis of large videos are still far behind. In this paper a fully automatic human-centric system for video summarization is proposed. In most of the surveillance applications, human motion is of great interest. In proposed system the moving parts in the video are detected using background subtraction, and blobs are extracted from the binary image. Human detection is done through Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. Then, motion of humans is tracked through consecutive frames using Kalman filter, and trajectory of each person is extracted. The analysis of trajectory leads to a meaningful summary which covers only important parts of video. One can also mark region of interest to be included in the summary. Experimental results show the proposed system reduces long video into meaningful summary and saves a lot of time and cost in terms of storage, indexing and browsing effort.'],\n",

To successfully monitor compliance with brace treatment, we designed and developed a wearable multi-modal sensor solution is embedded into the patient's brace. The custom designed hardware consists of a sensor board, a force sensor, an accelerometer and a gyroscope. The force sensor collects the force being exerted on the patient's back, while the accelerometer and gyroscope generate cues to determine the patient's activities and lifestyle. In this paper, we propose a novel data-mining method to identify patient activities and evaluate the effectiveness of the brace treatment pervasively based on fusion of continuous force and inertial motion recordings.

However, it is also possible to learn important metadata that can suggest how data should be manipulated in several advanced operations. In this paper, we show the potentiality of learning from data by focusing on the problem of relaxing the results of database queries, that is, trying to return some approximated answer to a query when a result for it is unavailable in the database, and the system will return an empty answer set, or even worse, erroneous mismatch results. In particular, we introduce a novel approach to rewrite queries that are in disjunctive normal form and contain a mixture of discrete and continuous attributes. The approach preprocesses data collections to discover the implicit relationships that exist among the various domain attributes, and then uses this knowledge to rewrite the constraints from the failing query. In a first step, the approach tries to learn a set of functional dependencies from the data, which are ranked according to special mechanisms that will successively allow to predict the order in which the extracted dependencies have to be used to properly rewrite the failing query. An experimental evaluation of the approach on three real data sets shows its effectiveness in terms of robustness and coverage.'],\n",

Then, a single ECHMM was trained using all the sequences obtained from a given running application; again, the classification accuracy has been evaluated using the same traces and it resulted about 76%.
